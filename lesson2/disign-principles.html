            <h2>Contrast and visual Hirachy</h2>
            <p>APPLE</p>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com">apple.com</a>
            <img src="images/apple1.jpg" alt="mobile screenshot">
            <p>The contrast ratio between black and white
                is as high as 21:1 according to the WAAG(Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
                which passes the AA and AAA for normal text, large text and Graphical object and user
                interface component(contrast). Also, still from the same screenshot, we easily notice a 
                hirachy in the aligment in font size. We notice descending order aligment in font sizes
                with "WATCH" being bigger followed by "Smart. Brighter. Mighter." which is less
                bigger and "Available Starting 9.22" being smallest (visual Hirachy).

            <h2>Repetition and proximity</h2>
            <p>TOSHIBA</p>

            <img src="images/toshiba1.jpg" alt="mobile screenshot">
            <p>On the above screenshot from the toshiba website, we obseve two sectons with each
               section composed of an image, a heading text, a paragraph text and a lean more link
                which are closer together than they are closer to elements from the next section, likely showing a relationship
                between those elements(proximity).
                On the other hand, we observe a repetion in the disposition of elements in 
                each section (image, heading text, paragraph tex and link) as well as a repetion
                of sections themselves.

            <img src="images/spacex1.jpg" alt="mobile screenshot">
            <p>Very few text on the screenshot leaving an empty space both from the top and 
                and bottom makes it look less congested as well as the "LEARN MORE" tex in the botton
                is spaced out from the borders of the botton making it look visualy apealing (white spaces).
                Notice the size of the button which makes it easy to be found because it is big in size and 
                eveident making it stand out (This designer definitely applied the Fitt's Law principle).
